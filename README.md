For the user to match the hidden code.
The user can select colors by choosing a color on the left panel and then clicking a button on the row.
A color cannot be used more than once.
To reset a button - right click for the color to be reset to the default.
When all buttons have a color the DONE SELECTION button will be enabled and the user can click when ready.
